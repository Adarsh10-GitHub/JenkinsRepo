Now the home page routes to the same page . Discounts Routes to another Discount component and the user profile icon when clicked shows 3 options edit profile , your orders and Log out . Now in this dashboard instead of creating a list of static movie objects and using  it , I wish to get the list of movie objects from the backend which is spring boot and use that data to display it .and this list might be used in different components , so make sure to that the same list once created and can be used in multiple components. Also the routing can be done in the app.js or index.js
